This is a Python GUI to search text data in CHINESE! [Code is in English though :-P]

This is a retrieval program for “Ji Cheng Musical Score” of Kunqu Opera.
The data collected melodies�� information that appeared in the Score with their general properties such as tonality (Gong Diao) , style and classification.
The GUI program allowed users to locate melodies by searching for different classes of keyword(s) through the information collected and return corresponding entries to user.
