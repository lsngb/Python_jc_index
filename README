This is a Python GUI to search text data in CHINESE! [Code is in English though :-P]

The data collected melodies’ information that appeared in the Score with their general properties such as tonality (Gong Diao) , style and classification.
The GUI program allowed users to locate melodies by searching for different classes of keyword(s) through the information collected and return corresponding entries to user.

=====================================================

说明：
基础内容与《P庐曲谈》卷三曲牌检索部分一致，新增“剧目”一栏方便使用。
